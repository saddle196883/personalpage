My full name is Timothy Wan Kai Yang. From August 2025, I will be beginning my PhD studies in Mathematics in the National University of Singapore.

My current mathematical interests are varied. While I have not decided on the topic of my PhD yet, it will likely be in fluid dynamics and/or partial differential equations. I am also interested in studying various semantics of non-classical logics. For instance, my final year project in my undergraduate career is on using algebraic semantics to demonstrate a certain conservativity result in linear logic. I hope that in the coming months and years, I will also pick up other semantics like game semantics or categorical semantics. 

Aside from mathematics, I am a proficient keyboard warrior (hence this personal site), I fold origami occasionally, I solve some programming exercises and I play gacha games.

I am fluent in English and Mandarin Chinese, and I have completed the German language sequence in my undergraduate career. (In theory, this takes me to a ~B1 level.) I am also learning Japanese, in order to be able to watch Hololive streams without relying on translators or clippers, but I expect that this will take a long time.
