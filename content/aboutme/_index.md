My full name is Timothy Wan Kai Yang. As of now, I have just begun my PhD studies in Mathematics in the National University of Singapore.

My PhD topic will almost surely be in the area of fluid dynamics and/or partial differential equations. Outside of that, I am also interested in studying various semantics of non-classical logics. My final year project in my undergraduate career was on using algebraic semantics to demonstrate a certain conservativity result in linear logic. I hope that in the coming months and years, I will also pick up knowledge about other semantics like game semantics or categorical semantics. I would also like to learnnumerical methods a lot more seriously, as I want to be able to do numerical simulations of the various PDEs that I will invitably study.

Aside from mathematics, I am a proficient keyboard warrior (hence this personal site), I fold origami occasionally, I solve some programming exercises and I play gacha games. I have also recently gotten addicted to Factorio and Crosscode.

I am fluent in English and Mandarin Chinese, and I have completed the German language sequence in my undergraduate career. (In theory, this takes me to a ~B1 level.) I am also learning Japanese, in order to be able to watch Hololive streams without relying on translators or clippers, but I expect that this will take a long time. In this regard, I am going through the Japanese language sequence in the university now. Taking language classes is very fun, I gain a lot from it, and it also serves as  a form of procrastination from actually doing serious mathematics.

# Courses I am Taking This Semester
- LAJ2202 Japanese 3
- MA5233 Computational Mathematics
- MA5253 Riemann Surfaces
- MA5260 Advanced Probability
- MA6222 Topics in Logic

This semester, I would like to broaden my horizons and explore a bunch of different ideas. This also serves to clear the mathematics classes in my graduation requirements. Also, as I have already cleared the PDE sequence in the university as an undergraduate, I will be learning about PDEs mainly through self-reading.

# Texts/Notes that I am Reading
The purpose of this list is to publicly declare what texts I am reading so that I feel the social pressure to actually go through them. 
- *Vorticity and Incompressible Flow* by Majda and Bertozzi
- *The Mathematical Analysis of the Incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations* by Bedrossian and Vicol

# Other Things I Aim To Do
- I hope to run at least twice a week to keep healthy.
- I hope to pick up the Julia programming language. Perhaps I can implement the algorithms in the computational mathematics class as Julia scripts.
